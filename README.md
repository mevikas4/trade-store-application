# trade-store-application
develop a trade store that organizes and stores each trade 

Develop a Java application utilizing Spring Boot and a streaming tool, incorporating both SQL and NoSQL databases. Ensure all functionalities are covered with JUnit tests, adopting a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Set up a deployment pipeline, preferably through GitHub Actions, or alternatively, Jenkins. This pipeline should include automated regression testing and an Open Source Software vulnerability scan, with the build failing upon detection of critical or blocker vulnerabilities. If feasible, please use PlantUML to create necessary sequence, class, or design diagrams.

Problem Statement
Imagine a situation where thousands of trades are being sent to a single store, through any method of transmission. Our objective is to develop a trade store that organizes and stores each trade in a specific sequence.
